# JS30
I am mostly a backend programmer with Java and Spring Boot, but I am very interested about JavaScript and it's various frameworks.
I learned basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript as part of my studies, but now I am going to relearn everything from scratch, 
using https://learn.freecodecamp.org/ and https://javascript30.com/
